# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML

This is a task that perform the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data.
